# Bird Migration


This repo will take a look at the migration paths of three birds named Eric, Nico, and Sanne. My team explored a variety of different variables among the three trips including distance traveled, when they migrated, speed, altitude, and more. Run [our analysis](BirdExploration.ipynb) for more! 

You can also view our report as an [html](BirdExploration.html) or [pdf](BirdExploration.pdf), but I suggest you run the code yourself. Our analysis contains interactive plots that you can zoom in on and manipulate, which gives a very good look at all the data, but they do not appear in html or pdf files. If you still wish to use these files, then you can find static images of the plots in the [plots folder](plots)

### How to run our analysis:

All of the files needed for this analysis are included in this repository. 

1. Download the [Bird_Exploration](BirdExploration.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook and the [bird_tracking](bird_tracking.csv) CSV File
2. Run all of the package installs and imports (if any of the installs give you an issue, it may help to add --user to the end of that line of code)
3. Run all of the remaining lines of code and our plots should pop up!
